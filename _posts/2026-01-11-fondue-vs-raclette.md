## Welcome to our cheesy land! 🧀

If there is one thing we know how to do here, it’s melted cheese. Our national cheese market is worth a massive CHF 2.45 billion ($2.85 billion). Every winter, the same big debate starts heating up: Fondue or Raclette? Even McDonald's ads started taking over the debate.
So we looked at the numbers, and some might surprise you!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### The Internet Star: Fondue

If we let the internet decide, fondue is the undisputed champion. When the snow starts to fall here, everyone reaches for their phones to search for this friendly cozy meal.

**The Search Arena:** According to Google search data, the volume for "fondue" is typically much higher than for "raclette". Is this because we are looking for recipes, while raclette is simpler? Beware of the "fondue chinoise", which also contributes to the volume!

**The Big Sellers:** Fondue is the main way we sell our beloved Gruyère and Emmentaler to the world. Gruyère is actually our most-eaten traditional cheese, with each of us finishing about 1.74 kg of it every year.

### The Social Star: Raclette

While fondue wins the "search war" on Google, raclette is winning our hearts. Lately, there has been a huge move toward the "experience economy": we don't just want to eat, we want a show! Scraping melted cheese off a big wheel is incredibly social and looks amazing on your phone.

**Purity of Intent:** Even though we eat 1.35 kg of raclette cheese per capita, this number is special. Why? Because while people use Gruyère for sandwiches or snacks, raclette cheese is almost only used for the actual meal ritual. When you buy it, you mean business!

**World Record Vibes:** In April 2025, we proved how much we love it by breaking a world record in Martigny. Nearly 5,000 people gathered to eat over 2,037 kg of cheese. The tickets were so popular they sold out in just one hour and 20 minutes!

**Decades-Long Trend**: For the past 2 decades, the search trend has been clearly moving in favor of raclette, with a search volume ratio going from over ~5 all the way down to ~2 in 2025-2026 (peak is the highest daily volume occuring in winter, total is the entire annual volume).

### The Final Verdict: Who is More Popular? 🏆

Determining a single winner is tough because both dishes are so important to us. Fondue is the economic heavyweight—it completely dominates the Google search data and keeps our hard-cheese exports strong.
However, popularity is about more than just search numbers. Looking at the pure enthusiasm of the Swiss people, the massive social media buzz, the "purity of intent" in how we buy the cheese, and the incredible world-record turnout, there is a clear favorite for our social lives.

**The Conclusive Winner: RACLETTE! 🥇**

While fondue owns the search engines, raclette owns the soul of our social gatherings, and is even quickly gaining ground in search results vs fondue. It is the "Winner of the Heart" and the current most popular choice for a truly Swiss celebration.
